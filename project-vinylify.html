                A diary study was conducted with a prototype that includes features of record players into an online music platform on mobile phones. Preliminary results reveal that the features do improve people’s ownership and experience, even displaying some slow-tech qualities. This study is the first step towards an age of post-digitalism, where we explore the limits of smart-tech and the inclusion of slow-tech to create a more balanced and healthy relationship with our devices.

                    To understand the appeal of retro-tech, we interviewed 6 users who embrace both old and new technologies. Half were avid readers, while the other half were regular record player users.

                    To test if retro habits positively influence modern usage, we conducted a five-day diary study with two participants. They received functionally identical Vinylify prototypes, each with four favorite albums on NFC-embedded mini records.

                    Participants were free to use the device as they wished. Daily diary entries collected via Microsoft Teams prompted them to reflect on their usage and experience through evolving questions. This method allowed us to capture in-depth, longitudinal data on how the physical interaction influenced their daily listening habits.

                    The study concluded with personalized semi-structured interviews, comparing the prototype experience directly with modern music players. This mixed-method approach provided deep insights into how embodied interaction shifts the user's relationship with digital music.

                In this qualitative study, we reintroduced embodied interaction and personality from retro tech into smart technology. Two participants experienced a prototype in the form of a portable mobile vinyl player.

            <p class="body-text" id="txt-p-conc-2" style="font-weight: 600;">
                Our main contribution from the findings of our diary study is how smart tech can be improved by looking at features that keep retro tech alive. Aside from the benefits of improved personality and experience, we unintentionally found that our prototype also has slow-tech advantages. Therefore, we concluded that smart tech can also learn from having a balance of slow-tech attributes.
